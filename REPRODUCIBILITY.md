# Reproducibility

This repository is designed to support transparency and reproducibility.

## Audio Reproduction
- Exact audio files and generation parameters are provided
- Headphone-based listening is required to preserve binaural effects

## Session Controls
To reproduce the experiment:
- Use the same audio files
- Maintain consistent volume
- Keep posture, environment, and session timing consistent

## Analysis Reproducibility
- EEG processing steps are documented
- Scripts (if included) are version-controlled
- Figures can be regenerated from raw data using provided methods

---

## Limitations
- Single-participant design
- Exploratory analysis
- Results are not generalizable
