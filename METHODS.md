# Methods

## Study Design
This study uses a **single-subject, randomized crossover design** to compare EEG
activity during binaural-beat audio exposure versus matched control audio.

Each session consists of:
1. Baseline recording (silence)
2. Audio exposure (binaural or control)

The order of conditions is randomized across sessions.

## Audio Conditions

### Binaural-Beat Condition
- Two slightly different frequencies presented separately to each ear
- Embedded within identical background music
- Designed to create an interaural frequency difference

### Control Condition
- Identical music and carrier tones
- No interaural frequency difference (same signal to both ears)

All audio files are matched for:
- Duration
- Volume
- Musical content

---

## EEG Recording

- **Device:** Non-invasive EEG headset
- **Placement:** Manufacturer-recommended electrode locations
- **Sampling rate:** Device default
- **Environment:** Quiet indoor room
- **Posture:** Seated, minimal movement

Sessions are terminated immediately if discomfort occurs.

## Outcome Measures

- EEG band power (delta, theta, alpha, beta)
- Optional derived metrics (e.g., alpha/beta ratio)

---

## Data Analysis

- EEG signals are preprocessed to remove artifacts
- Spectral power is computed using standard signal-processing techniques
- Comparisons are made across repeated sessions for each condition
