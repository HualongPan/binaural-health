# Binaural Health Tools

**Research & Educational Materials (Non-Clinical)**

This repository hosts materials for a student research project investigating
EEG signal changes during exposure to binaural-beat audio compared with
matched control audio in a single-subject design.

The purpose of this repository is transparency and reproducibility. It contains
audio stimuli descriptions, analysis methods, and documentation related to an
exploratory EEG study.

## Project Overview

- **Study type:** Single-subject, randomized crossover
- **Primary measurement:** EEG spectral features (e.g., alpha, theta, beta band power)
- **Comparison:** Binaural-beat audio vs matched control audio
- **Participant:** One participant (the student researcher)

This project focuses exclusively on **measurement and comparison of EEG patterns**
and does **not** evaluate medical efficacy or health outcomes.
